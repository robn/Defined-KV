=head1 NAME

Defined::KV - Create a KV pair, but only if the value is defined

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Defined::KV;
    use Test::More;

    my $foo;
    my $bar = 1;
    my $baz = 0;

    my %dict = (
      defined_kv(foo => $foo),
      defined_kv(bar => $bar),
      defined_kv(baz => $baz),
    );

    is_deeply(\%dict, { bar => 1, baz => 0 });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Defined::KV> exports a single function, C<defined_kv>. Call it with two arguments. If the second argument is defined, both are returned, otherwise nothing is returned.

This exists to replace this construct:

    (defined $v ? ($k => $v) : ())

with something less awkward and repetetive, namely:

    defined_kv($k => $v)
